                Jotaro Kujo's greatest strength lies in his Stand, *Star Platinum*, which grants him immense physical power, incredible speed, and precision, along with the ability to stop time for brief moments. His sharp intellect and calm, strategic thinking in the heat of battle also make him a formidable opponent. However, Jotaro's biggest weakness is his emotional distance and stoic nature. He often struggles to express his feelings, which leads to strained relationships with those close to him, including his family. This emotional detachment sometimes makes it difficult for him to connect with others, despite his deep care for them.
